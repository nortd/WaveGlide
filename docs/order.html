<p>Please let us know if you want to purchase a WaveGlide: waveglide {at} nortd {dot} com. This will motivate us to get it out as a product soon. At the moment we have no idea how many people would be interested.</p>

<p>WaveGlide is not a product yet. Currently if you want to have one you have to build one yourself. It's designed in a way to make this quite feasible for any technically inclined person. See <a href="build.html">build instructions</a>.</p>
